# Client Side Chatbot

#### This build is very similiar to [https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node](https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node). The main difference is that this app will run entirely on the client side while [https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node](https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node) makes XHR requests to a node server for the bot logic and product data. Also, a bit of the UX/UI is different and unit testing found at [https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node](https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node).


#### Please see [https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node](https://github.com/JacobWylie/chatbot-node) for more details.
